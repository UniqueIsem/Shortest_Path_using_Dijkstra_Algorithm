# Shortest_Path_using_Dijkstra_Algorithm
GUI interface with graphs that give us the shortest path between a start ponint to a end even with barrers, all of this selected by the user.

There is two Frames "VtnPath" and "Vtn", this two have a funcionaly flood algorithm, but "VtnPath" cannot find the end point and either can calculate the shortest path. On the other hand, "Vtn" has both algorithms running correctly.
